# Privacy Policy for Unbreakable Password Generator

**Last Updated: November 2025**

## Our Privacy Promise

Unbreakable Password Generator is built on a simple principle: **your passwords are yours, and yours alone.**

We promise:

✅ **No Data Collection** - We don't collect any data  
✅ **No Tracking** - We don't track your usage  
✅ **No Analytics** - We don't monitor your activity  
✅ **No Network Requests** - The extension operates 100% offline  
✅ **No Servers** - We don't have any servers that could log data  
✅ **No Third Parties** - We don't share data with anyone (because we don't have any)  

## What This Extension Does

Unbreakable Password Generator:

- Generates cryptographically secure passwords using the Web Crypto API
- Runs entirely in your browser, on your device
- Makes **zero network requests**
- Does not transmit any data over the internet
- Does not communicate with any external servers

## What Data We Collect

**None.**

We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any data of any kind.

## What Data We Store Locally

The extension may store the following **locally on your device only**:

- **User Preferences**: Your chosen password length and character type selections (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

This data:
- Is stored using Chrome's local storage API
- Never leaves your device
- Is never transmitted over the network
- Can be cleared at any time by removing the extension

**We do NOT store:**
- Generated passwords
- Any personally identifiable information
- Usage statistics
- Analytics data
- Browsing history
- Any other user data

## Permissions

This extension requests the following permissions:

### Storage Permission
**Why we need it:** To save your password preferences (length, character types) between sessions.

**What we do with it:** Store only your UI preferences locally on your device.

**What we DON'T do:** We never store generated passwords, and preferences never leave your device.

### Clipboard Write Permission
**Why we need it:** To allow you to copy generated passwords to your clipboard with one click.

**What we do with it:** Write generated passwords to your clipboard only when you click "Copy."

We do not use any third-party services, including:

- No analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
- No crash reporting
- No advertising networks

- No CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)

The extension is 100% self-contained with zero external dependencies.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect any data, there's no data to secure. However:

- All password generation uses the Web Crypto API for cryptographically secure randomness
- Passwords are generated locally and never transmitted
- No passwords are ever stored, logged, or transmitted
